# CS112

A collection of Projects completed in Rutgers' CS112 Data Structures Class. 
They include: 
 - Polynomial (involving Linked Lists): Wrote a program that Added, Multiplied, and Evaluated a Polynomial Using Linked Lists
 - Expression Evaluation (involving Stacks): Wrote a program that used Stacks and ArrayLists to evaluate expressions involving numbers, parenthesis, variables, and arrays
 - Trie (involving Trees): Wrote a program that classified words in a trie according to their common prefixes
 - Little Search Engine (involving Hash Maps and Tables): Wrote a program that read multiple text files and organized words inside them according to their frequency and which document they were found in. The program also helped users search for individual words as well as the most common words in a set of text files. 
 - Friends (involving Graphs): Wrote a program that interpreted a graph structure passed to it. The program specifically determined the shortest path between 2 entered points, which graph nodes shared a common property, and which graph nodes were necessary to be able to access the entire graph from a predetermined source traverse location
